		<H1>About New Vistas Christian School</H1>
	

			<p>
			New Vistas Christian School is located in beautiful Martinez, California. It was founded in 1978 by Bonnie Reynold after a successful summer Program. 
			We are a private Christian school dedicated to educating the bright students who are not experiencing academic success from 5th through 12th grade. Utilizing multi-sensory teaching methods, increasing the studentâ€™s self esteem and giving them Biblical standards to live by has enriched the lives of hundreds of students who have attended New Vistas. We use Slingerland Approach which is a supportive program that encourages academic competence, effective work habits and self-discipline. Students gain self-confidence and enthusiasm for learning as they experience success in school.
